This is a basic CSS/HTML5 photoblog with gradient background,
fading hover, all images are credited through direct links. Any image uncredited either belongs to me, or credit wasn't necessary. 
This was originally a super basic photo blog, but I took the liberty of using some advance CSS on it. Play around with the images, and colors, as well as hovers until you get the hang of it.
I may come back and add more features.
